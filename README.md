# 🏃‍♂️ Runner: Code Execution Platform

This is a TCC (Trabalho de Conclusão de Curso) project designed to support the execution and evaluation of code submissions in multiple programming languages inside isolated environments (containers). It includes a web interface, API, and infrastructure to run, test, and manage code for contests and problem solving.

## 📦 Monorepo Stack

* **Monorepo:** [Nx](https://nx.dev/) for project structure and dependency graph
* **Runtime:** [Bun](https://bun.sh/) for fast JavaScript/TypeScript execution
* **Linter/Formatter:** [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) for code quality
* **Containers:** Docker + Docker Compose for service orchestration
* **Database:** PostgreSQL
* **Cache/Queue:** Redis (for job queueing and caching)
* **Runners:** Language-specific isolated containers (e.g., `cpp`, `python`)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
* [Bun](https://bun.sh/)
* [Nx CLI](https://nx.dev/cli/nx)

### Development Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
bun install

# Start all services
docker compose up --build
```

> The services will include:
>
> * `runner-db` (PostgreSQL)
> * `runner-redis` (Redis)
> * `runner-cpp` (C++ sandbox environment)

---

## 🧪 Features

* ✅ Secure code execution with time/resource limits
* ✅ Isolated runner containers per language
* ✅ Queue-based task processing (Redis)
* ✅ API for managing contests, problems, and submissions
* ✅ Code diffing and test case validation
* ✅ Realtime feedback for submissions

## 🧰 Commands

### Lint & Format

```bash
bun run lint        # via Biome
bun run format
```

### API Dev Server

```bash
nx run api:dev
```

### Web App

```bash
nx run web:dev
```

    command: redis-server --appendonly yes
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "redis-cli", "ping"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 3
      start_period: 10s
    restart: always
